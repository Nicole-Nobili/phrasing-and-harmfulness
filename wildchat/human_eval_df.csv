952,"Please rewrite the following to make it more engaging ""Blood is Thicker Than Water
Sometimes we use phrases in ways that differ from their original meaning.
For instance, you’ve heard the phrase, “Blood is thicker than water.” You probably think it means something like, “Family relationships are stronger than other relationships.” Indeed, that is how people commonly use the phrase today.
It referred to the water of the womb, representing a close maternal, family connection.

Knowing this, you realize that the phrase “blood is thicker than water” actually meant that though family relationships form a close connection, some other relationships may be even stronger.""",IMP,y,IMP

4685,"Essentially you must create a program that can plot a function that is in the form
z = f(x,y)
Your program must generate input values between -1 and 1 in increments of .1 and use this to plot x, y, and z vertices to be included as part of a mesh that will then be graphically displayed.
If you would like you can implement the functionality to allow both the function to be mapped as expressed as a mathematical formula and the input values to be entered by the user of your program, however, this is optional.
for (x=Min_x; x<=Max_x; x+=.01)
{
for(y=Min_y; y<=Max_y; y+= .01)
{
z = fun(x,y); // note that fun must evaluate the expression
