He charges $1.5 per trip and then 5% of the price of the groceries. Calculate how many dollars' worth of groceries he delivered if he makes 40 trips and has saved up enough.\\n\\nA: To calculate the total amount of groceries delivered, we need to know the total value of the groceries delivered. Since Alex charges $1.5 per trip and 5% of the price of the groceries, we can calculate the total value of the groceries as follows:\\n\\nTotal value of groceries = Number of trips x $1.5 per trip x (5% of groceries price)\\n\\nSince Alex makes 40 trips, the total value of the groceries he delivered is:\\n\\nTotal value of groceries = 40 x $1.5 x (5% of $14,600)\\n= $<<40\\\\*1.5\\\\*5%=660>>660\\n\\nSo, Alex delivered $660 worth of groceries.\\n\\nFinal answer: $660 ####\",\n",

With the need to keep $500 for a license and registration, and three times that amount for docking fees, calculate the length of the longest boat he can buy.\\n\\nA: According to the problem, Mitch has saved $20000, and a new boat costs $1500 per foot in length. To calculate the length of the longest boat he can buy, we need to subtract the amounts needed for a license and registration, and then multiply that result by three to account for docking fees.\\n\\nLet's break it down step by step:\\n\\n1. First, we need to subtract the amount needed for a license and registration: $500.\\n\\n$20000 - $500 = $<<20000-500=19500>>19500\\n\\n2. Next, we need to multiply the result by three to account for docking fees:\\n\\n$19500 x 3 = $<<19500*3=58500>>58500\\n\\nTherefore, the longest boat Mitch can buy is 58.5 feet long.\\n\\nFinal answer: $58500 ####\",\n",

Calculate how much money the candy store made.\\n\\nA: To calculate the total amount of money the candy store made, we need to multiply the weight of each item by its selling price.\\n\\n1. Fudge: 20 pounds x $2.50/pound = $<<20\\\\*2.50=50>>50\\n2. Chocolate truffles: 5 dozen x $1.50 each = $<<5\\\\*1.50=7.50>>7.50\\n3. Chocolate-covered pretzels: 3 dozen x $2.00 each = $<<3\\\\*2.00=6.00>>6.00\\n\\nTotal amount of money the candy store made = $50 + $7.50 + $6.00 = $<<50+7.50+6.00=122.50>>122.50\\n\\nTherefore, the candy store made a total of $122.50.\\n\\nFinal answer: $122.50 ####',\n",

One-third of Jorge's 60 acres of land is clay-rich soil and the rest is good soil. Calculate how many bushels of corn Jorge's land yielded last year.\\n\\nA: To find out how many bushels of corn Jorge's land yielded last year, we need to calculate the total number of bushels that will be produced on both the good soil and the clay-rich soil, and then add them up.\\n\\nOn the good soil, the yield is 400 bushels per acre, so the total number of bushels produced on the 40 acres of good soil is 400 x 40 = 16,000 bushels.\\n\\nOn the clay-rich soil, the yield is half as much as on the good soil, so the total number of bushels produced on the 20 acres of clay-rich soil is 400 x 20 = 8,000 bushels.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number of bushels of corn that Jorge's land yielded last year is 16,000 + 8,000 = 24,000 bushels.\\n\\nFinal answer: 24,000 bushels. ####\",\n",

Determine how many minutes on average faster this year's winner ran one mile of the race compared to last year, given that the winner finishes the race in 42 minutes and last year's winner finished in 47.25 minutes.\\n\\nA: To find out how many minutes faster this year's winner ran one mile of the race compared to last year, we need to divide the difference in their finish times by the distance of the race.\\n\\nDistance of the race = 3/4 mile = 0.75 miles\\n\\nTime taken by last year's winner = 47.25 minutes\\n\\nTime taken by this year's winner = 42 minutes\\n\\nDifference in times = 47.25 - 42 = 5.25 minutes\\n\\nAverage time per mile = 5.25 / 0.75 = 7.0 minutes/mile\\n\\nSo, this year's winner ran one mile of the race 7 minutes faster than last year's winner.\\n\\nFinal answer: 7 minutes/mile\",\n",

[/INST]  Q: The cost of filling a car fuel tank is $45, and this can take you 500 miles before refilling. Mallory was going to her grammy's house, 2000 miles away. If she used 3/5 times as much money on food as she spent on filling the car fuel tank for the whole journey, calculate the total amount of money she used.\\n\\nA: To find out how much Mallory spent on food, we need to use the given information:\\n\\n* 3/5 = 0.6 (times as much money on food as spent on filling the car fuel tank)\\n* Total distance = 2000 miles\\n\\nSo, the total amount of money Mallory spent on food can be calculated as follows:\\n\\nTotal amount of money spent on food = Total distance x 0.6 x $45/mile\\n= 2000 miles x 0.6 x $45/mile\\n= $<<2000\\\\*0.6\\\\*45/mile=1200>>1200\\n\\nTherefore, Mallory used a total of $1200 on food for the whole journey.\\n\\nFinal answer: $1200\",\n",

She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. She works part-time 20 hours per week. Determine how many hours left over Madeline has.\\n\\nA: Madeline spends 18 hours/week in class, which is equal to 18/7 = $<<18/7=2.5>>2.5 hours per day.\\n\\nShe spends 4 hours/day on homework, which is equal to 4/7 = $<<4/7=0.57>>0.57 hours per day.\\n\\nShe spends 8 hours/day sleeping, which is equal to 8/7 = $<<8/7=1.14>>1.14 hours per day.\\n\\nShe works part-time 20 hours/week, which is equal to 20/7 = $<<20/7=2.86>>2.86 hours per day.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the total hours Madeline spends on these activities:\\n\\nTotal hours spent on class = 2.5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 17.5 hours/week\\nTotal hours spent on homework = 0.57 hours/day x 7 days/week = 3.99 hours/week\\nTotal hours spent on sleeping = 1.14 hours/day x 7 days/week = 7.91 hours/week\\nTotal hours spent on part-time work = 2.86 hours/day x 20 hours/week = 57.2 hours/week\\n\\nNow, let's subtract the total hours spent on these activities from the total hours Madeline has available:\\n\\nAvailable hours = 18 hours/week - 17.5 hours/week - 3.99 hours/week - 7.91 hours/week - 57.2 hours/week = 2.7 hours/week\\n\\nTherefore, Madeline has 2.7 hours/week left over.\\n\\nAnswer: 2.7 hours/week\",\n",

He reads 21 pages an hour when he reads novels, 30 pages an hour when he reads graphic novels, and 45 pages an hour when he reads comic books. Calculate how many pages he reads if he reads each for 1/3 of his time.\\n\\nA: Miles spends 1/6 of a day reading, which means he reads for 1/6 x 60 = 10 hours.\\n\\nSince he reads at different speeds for each type of book, we need to calculate how many pages he reads for each type of book.\\n\\n1. Novels: Miles reads 21 pages per hour, so he reads 21 x 10 = 210 pages of novels.\\n2. Graphic novels: Miles reads 30 pages per hour, so he reads 30 x 10 = 300 pages of graphic novels.\\n3. Comic books: Miles reads 45 pages per hour, so he reads 45 x 10 = 450 pages of comic books.\\n\\nTherefore, Miles reads a total of 210 + 300 + 450 = 960 pages in 10 hours.\\n\\nFinal answer: 960 pages ####',\n",
