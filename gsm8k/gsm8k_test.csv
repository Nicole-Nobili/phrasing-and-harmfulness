"When Jeffrey walks, for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backwards.  Therefore, if the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps, what is the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox?","For every 3 steps forward, he adds 2 more backwards so each 'step' gained costs 5 actual steps
66 steps distance * 5 steps moved = <<66*5=330>>330 steps total

Therefore, calculate the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox if the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps.","When Jeffrey walks, for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backwards.  Therefore, if the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps, what is the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox?","When Jeffrey walks, for every three steps forward, he takes two steps backwards. Therefore, I need to calculate the total number of steps Jeffrey takes when he goes from the house to the mailbox if the distance between the house and the mailbox is 66 steps.","For every 3 steps forward, Jeffrey effectively moves 1 step forward because he takes 2 steps back. To cover a distance of 66 steps, he needs to make 66 effective forward steps. Since each cycle of movement (3 steps forward and 2 steps back) results in 1 effective step forward, he needs to complete this cycle 66 times to reach the mailbox.

In each cycle, Jeffrey takes a total of 3 (forward) + 2 (backward) = 5 steps. Therefore, for 66 effective steps forward, he takes 5 * 66 = 330 steps in total. #### 330","For every 3 steps forward, Jeffrey effectively moves 1 step forward because he takes 2 steps back. To cover a distance of 66 steps, he needs to make this 3-step forward and 2-step backward motion 66 times. 

Since each cycle of motion (3 steps forward and 2 steps back) results in a net gain of 1 step, and he needs to cover 66 steps, he will go through this cycle 66 times. 

In each cycle, he takes 3 steps forward and 2 steps backward, which totals 5 steps. Therefore, for 66 steps, he will take 5 * 66 = 330 steps. #### 330",Error,Error
"Lydia is planning a road trip with her family and is trying to plan a route. She has 60 liters of fuel and she will use all of this during her trip. She isn't sure how much fuel she is going to use in the first third of the trip but she knows she will need a third of all of her fuel for the second third of the trip, and half this amount for the final third of the trip. How much fuel, in liters, can Lydia use in the first third of the trip?","In the second third of the trip, Lydia is going to use 60 liters of fuel / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 liters of fuel.
In the final third of the trip, she needs half of this amount so she is going to be using 20 liters / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 liters of fuel.
So in the first third, Lydia used the remaining amount of fuel which is 60 total liters of fuel – 20 liters of fuel in the second third – 10 liters of fuel in the final third = <<60-20-10=30>>30 liters of fuel.

I have to determine how much fuel, in liters, Lydia can use in the first third of the trip, knowing she will need a third of all of her fuel for the second third of the trip, and half this amount for the final third of the trip.","To solve this, let's break down the fuel usage across the three parts of the trip.

1. First third of the trip: Let's denote this amount as \(X\) liters.
2. Second third of the trip: This is given as a third of all her fuel, so it's \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20\) liters.
3. Final third of the trip: This is half the amount used in the second third, so it's \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10\) liters.

Adding the fuel for the second and final thirds of the trip gives us \(20 + 10 = 30\) liters. Since the total fuel is 60 liters, the fuel used in the first third of the trip is \(60 - 30 = 30\) liters.

#### 30","Lydia has 60 liters of fuel for the entire trip. 

For the second third of the trip, she will use a third of all her fuel, which is 60/3 = 20 liters. 

For the final third of the trip, she will use half of the amount used in the second third, which is 20/2 = 10 liters. 

Therefore, for the first third of the trip, she can use the remaining fuel, which is 60 - (20 + 10) = 60 - 30 = 30 liters. #### 30",Error,Error
